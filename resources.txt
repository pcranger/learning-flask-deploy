Resource: 
e.g: class UserRegister(Resource)
the api can send data as json file and do necessary things to it 
is api can interact with such as user, item, store, student
, is an external representation of an entity
from the client view, they are interacting with resources, and api responds with resources

Model:
e.g class User(): 
a helper class contains class methods that are helpful
model is the client, contain username for example to identify him
, is an internal representation of an entity


to simplyfy; models contain class to create objects, functions to manipulate that objects
and resources contain creation of objects and using those functions

json goes into api and get converted into objects

resources and models are modules, because it has __init__.py file
